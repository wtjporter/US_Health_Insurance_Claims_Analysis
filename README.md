# US_Health_Insurance_Claims_Analysis
Completed as part of the University of Waterloo's Statistics for Data Science course. An analysis of US Health Insurance Claims was completed using two sample t-tests, as well as OLS linear regression.

The conclusion reached is that if a claimant smoked, their charges tended to increase as their age, BMI, and the number of children increased.
Although the provided health insurance claims data is robust, the model would benefit from having a more evenly distributed population of smokers vs non-smokers. Also, the data would benefit from a more even distribution of claimants who have a BMI within the normal range vs overweight/obese.
Lastly, with the benefit of more evenly distributed data, the model produced by linear regression can then be applied to machine learning models, thereby automating the underwriting process, and saving insurance companies time/money by expediting the underwriting process.
